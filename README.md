## Introduction

ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects social interaction, communication, and behavior. Early diagnosis and intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with ASD. This project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically LSTM networks, to predict ASD from behavioral data.

## Proposed System

Our system involves collecting data from various sources, preprocessing the data, and using an LSTM network to predict ASD. The system is trained on a substantial dataset and evaluated using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy.

## Problem Definition

The main challenge is to accurately diagnose ASD in a timely manner to facilitate early intervention. Traditional methods rely on behavioral assessments and reports, which can be subjective. Our approach leverages deep learning to provide a more objective and data-driven diagnosis.

## Dataset

The project utilizes several datasets, including:
- Self-Stimulatory Behaviours Dataset (SSBD) for videos
- Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE-I) for MRI scans
- Publicly available ASD datasets such as ADI-R, ADOS, SSC, and NDAR


## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Enhancing_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder.git
    cd asd-diagnosis-deep-learning
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Implementation and Results

The project is implemented in Python, using TensorFlow and other libraries. The results show high accuracy in predicting ASD, with detailed performance metrics provided in the report.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques in improving the diagnosis of ASD. The use of LSTM networks provides a more accurate and efficient method for early detection, which can lead to better intervention strategies.
